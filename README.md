In this C++ console program, we can enter student names and grades in two modes:

Counter-controlled – enter an exact known number of students.

Sentinel-controlled – keep entering students until the user types STOP.

The program calculates the class average, highest and lowest grade, and it also shows Pass/Fail for each student.
